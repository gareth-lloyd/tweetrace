This was a quick django application put together for the Charity Hack Day in
London, 2011. The idea was to get some interactivity going between people
raising money on justgiving.com and people in their social networks, through
which they spread awareness of their activities.

It uses the Twitter Streaming API to watch for links to JustGiving pages. When
a link is detected, a JustGiving user that has registered with this site (using
Twitter OAuth) will automatically tweet back to award that supporter a 'badge'.

Repeated mentions and donations will give progressively better badges to
supporters.

Fundraisers also get an awareness score based on how well they are doing at
getting their campaign mentioned on Twitter.

This project won a prize for best use of the JustGiving API.
